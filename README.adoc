= Intellij Groovy Extension Module Bug

Intellij 14.0.2 does not support statically type checked Groovy extension modules.  This repository demonstrates the issue.  The core module adds an instance method to java.util.List named map which is a pseudonym for the Groovy collect method.  The client module then attempts to call the new `List` method.  Intellij 14.0.2 fails compilation with the message:

`Error:(13, 9) Groovyc: [Static type checking] - Cannot find matching method java.util.List#map(groovy.lang.Closure). Please check if the declared type is right and if the method exists.`

and

`Error:(15, 27) Groovyc: [Static type checking] - The variable [Example] is undeclared.`.

Intellij 13.1.6 and Gradle 2.2.1 compiles and runs the test code from the client module successfully.
